# Konvok
A constructed language meant to offer methods and tools to unambiguous and precisely convey meaning, a "loglang" if you will.

The name "Konvok" is a portmanteau (blend word) of the English words "Consistent" and "Vocalization", with the letter k replacing each c. This represents the founding idea behind the language that there should exist a one-to-one correspondence between each letter and their sounds. Because of this, Konvok has an extensive set of letters with 16 vowels and 22 consonants, for a total of 38 letters.

There are several attributes of the language that in my experience makes it rather unique. It natively supports both base-10 and base-12 mathematics with separate words for the numbers in each numerical system. The core class of words called nomaró consists of the nouns and the verbs, and each nomaró may be used as either a noun or as a verb. The syntactical rules are designed to leave no ambiguity as to how words combine to form meaning as a whole, with a set of implicit rules for general convencience that may be explicitly overridden if so desired. One such implicit rule is the special structure of the clauses, called "klaóstorokt" (another portmanteau from "clause structure").

A lot more could be said about the language here, but there is already much explained and shown in the other documents. For those that wish to learn it, I recommend reading the PDF called "Konvok - Introduction" and the dictionary document.

This is considered a work-in-progress and will likely remain so for many years to come. If you see a use for the language, feel free to use it non-commercially. For commercial use, reach out to me.
